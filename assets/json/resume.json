        "introduction": "Greetings! I'm Dr. Hackman, a computer science enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for data science. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from National Chiao Tung University, where I also completed a one-year postdoc fellowship. For both my Ph.D. and fellowship, I was supervised by Prof. Vincent S. Tseng. Prior to this, I earned my master's in computer science from Yuan Ze University and my bachelor's in computer science from The University of The Gambia. My Ph.D. dissertation is titled A Study on Trend Analysis in High Utility Itemset Mining. My research interests include data mining, machine learning, medical AI, deep learning, generative AI, and data analytics. Currently, my research is focused on the medical field, aligning with my current job position. In this role, I aim to develop medical AI models that can make a positive impact on the healthcare sector.",
